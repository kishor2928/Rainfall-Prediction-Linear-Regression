# Rainfall-Prediction-Linear-Regression
This project centers on predicting precipitation levels using weather data collected from Austin, Texas. The analysis begins with thorough data preprocessing, which is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the dataset. This phase includes handling missing values through imputation methods, converting non-numeric data (such as categorical variables) into a numeric format suitable for modeling, and dropping irrelevant columns that do not contribute meaningfully to the predictive task.

Following the preprocessing stage, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This includes examining the distribution of precipitation across various months, which helps to identify seasonal trends and patterns. Data visualization techniques, such as histograms and scatter plots, are employed to illustrate the relationship between month and precipitation levels, allowing for a deeper understanding of how weather conditions change throughout the year.

Once the data is prepared, it is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate model evaluation. A linear regression model is then trained on the training dataset to predict precipitation levels based on the identified weather attributes. To assess the effectiveness of the model, a range of evaluation metrics is calculated, including the R-squared score, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's accuracy and predictive power.
